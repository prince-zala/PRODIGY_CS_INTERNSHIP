1). Caesar Cipher Implementation
(Developed a Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher technique by shifting characters with a user-defined key.)

2). Image Encryption Using Pixel Manipulation
(Created an image encryption tool that secures images by applying mathematical operations on pixel values, allowing encryption and decryption using a secret key.)

3). Password Strength Assessment Tool
(Built a password strength checker that evaluates passwords based on length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters, and provides feedback to users.)

4). Keylogger for Educational Purposes
(Designed a basic keylogging program that records keystrokes and saves them to a file, strictly for learning input monitoring concepts with user consent.)

5). Network Packet Sniffer
(Implemented a packet sniffer using Python to capture and analyze network packets, displaying source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data for educational use.)
